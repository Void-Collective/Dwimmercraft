## Dwimmercraft
Have you ever wished you could say a few magic words and you would summon up a tornado and create chaos? If so, well you took a wrong turn somewhere but do not fear. Dwimmercraft has its own magic as well (even though you probably will never be able to summon up a tornado). With this add-on, you have the potential to become a powerful witch by growing your plants, brewing up draughts and potions, performing magic within circles of chalk, maintaining a good enough relationship with the spirits of your world and conjuring them to lend you their power. Witches with no fear of the Darkness can even ally themselves with Umdos, the Great Spirit of the Void. This may result in unwanted consequences, though the power gained seems to make up for this for most Obscure Witches. Well, what are you waiting for? Your mystical (and albeit painful) journey awaits within the world of Dwimmercraft!
